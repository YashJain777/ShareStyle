Project Description: ShareStyle – Ethnic Clothes Rental Platform
ShareStyle is a web-based platform designed to make ethnic fashion more accessible and sustainable. The platform allows individual dress owners and rental shopkeepers to list, manage, and rent out ethnic dresses. Users can browse available options and rent outfits for special occasions without the need to purchase them outright.

✨ Key Features:
1. Dress Listing for Owners: Individuals can add their own ethnic outfits to the platform and earn by renting them out.

2. Rental Shop Management: Shop owners can register and manage their inventory, keeping track of their rental dresses.

3. Local Storage Integration: Data is stored using local storage for lightweight and fast retrieval during development.

4. User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI ensures easy navigation for both renters and owners.
